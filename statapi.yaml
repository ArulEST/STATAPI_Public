    #   The Orders module is designed to streamline the management of orders within the application. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints and functionalities that allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete orders. This module serves as the backbone for order processing, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for the customers and administrators. 
      
      
    #   Key features of the Orders module include: 


    #     •	**Order Creation:** Users can submit new orders through dedicated endpoints, specifying essential details such as collection and delivery location, quantities and price and tracking information. 
      
      
    #     •	**Order Retrieval:** Retrieve detailed information about existing orders, including order tracking number, status, collection and delivery location, and customer details. 
      
      
    #     •	**Order Modification:** Update order information, such as quantities, signature flag through secure and straightforward endpoints. 
      
      
    #     •	**Order Deletion:** When necessary, users can cancel orders, and the module handles the necessary updates and notifications. 
      
      
    #     •	**Order Status Tracking:** Easily monitor the status of orders, from creation to shipment and delivery, enabling real-time order tracking for customers and staff.
